	These games are my favorite games to play. I love how competitive they can get and how much fun they are to play. I love being able to play these games with friends and to be able to improve at the games. I listed different types of games for the people that might not have one or two of these platforms. Go down to the description of the game to find out the prices of these games and my top reasons for playing these games.

		Minecraft is my top pick for a computer game. It is a very fun game, but there is one drawback. It costs $27. If you are willing to pay that, the game will be saved to your Microsoft account forever. Even though you have to buy it, I highly recommend doing so.

		Rocket League is probably my favorite game ever. It is so fun and you can go proffesional if you get good enough. It is also free, which makes it even better. This game is actually available on your computer too. This is a great option for a lot of people if you don't have or want to buy a console. I highly recommend getting this game.

		Clash of Clans is a super fun game to play if you want to pass the time while your on the go or in a line. It is a free game for mobile and it is a great option. You get to build a personal customized base, and attack other people's bases. If you end up liking it enough, you can make in app purchases to get better rewards and prizes.
